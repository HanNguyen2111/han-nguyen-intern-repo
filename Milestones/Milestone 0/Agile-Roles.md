# Research & Learn

## What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?
- **Developers**: Write the code, build features, and fix bugs.
- **QA (Quality Assurance)**: Test things before release to make sure everything works as expected and meets quality standards.
- **Product Manager (PM)**: Sets the product goals, prioritises tasks, and makes sure the product meets our customer requirements.
- **Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)**: Helps the team stay on track, removes blockers, and makes sure the workflow runs smoothly.
- **Other supporting roles (e.g., stakeholders, UX, customer support)**:
 + UX Designers: Design user-friendly interfaces and user flows.
 + Stakeholders: Give feedback and business direction.
 + Customer Support: Share feedback from real users and report any issues.

## How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?
### In Scrum:
- The team works in sprints (usually 1–4 weeks).
- There are regular meetings like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, reviews, and retrospectives.
- Everyone has a more defined role. e.g, the PM set direction for the project and manage backlog, the Scrum Master manages development team, and Developers will build the product according to tasks assigned in each sprint.

### In Kanban:
- There are no sprints. Tasks are picked up when there’s capacity. 
- The focus is on keeping things moving through the board.
- Roles are more flexible as everyone helps manage the board and keeps work flowing.
- Less meetings, more focus on progress and visual tracking.

#  Reflection

## What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
My role is UX designer. My respnsibility is to make sure the product is easy to use, accessible, and visually clear for users. In the Agile process, I work closely with the Product Manager to understand user needs and translate them into wireframes or prototypes. I also review feedback to continuously improve the user experience. 
## How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
My work often overlaps with developers, as I hand off designs and make sure the implementation matches the intended experience. I also interact with the Product Manager, who shares user priorities and feature goals.

# Task

## Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.
As a UX designer intern, I help the team make sure the product is user-friendly and enhance user engagement. My job is to understand the user’s needs and turn them into designs that developers can build. I support the team by creating wireframes, Figma prototypes, and refining designs based on feedbacks, while keeping things aligned with the product goals.

## Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.
I'll collaborate closely with Developers to make sure the designs are implemented properly. To improve teamwork, I can make my designs more clear by using tools like Figma comments, writing notes, and checking in regularly to answer any questions they have. Keeping communication open helps reduce confusion and speeds up the process.
