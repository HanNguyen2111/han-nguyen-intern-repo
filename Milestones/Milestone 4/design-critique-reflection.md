## What is design critique, and why is it a crucial part of the UX process?
Design critique is a structured way for team members to give feedback on a design. The goal is to improve the design by spotting problems, sharing perspectives, and making sure the solution really works for users. It’s important because it helps catch issues early, encourages collaboration, and builds stronger, user-centered designs.
## What are the key principles of giving helpful, constructive feedback?   
Key principles of giving helpful, constructive feedback include being specific, focusing on behavior rather than personality, being timely, and offering solutions-oriented advice. It's also crucial to create a safe and respectful environment, and to balance positive and negative feedback. 
## How should designers receive and apply critique without taking it personally?
- See feedback as a learning tool: having a perspective of thinkinking of critique as a chance to make the design better, not as a personal attack. It’s about the work, not about the person.
- Listen and understand first: Hear people out without interrupting. Ask questions if something isn’t clear, and take notes so I can reflect later.
- Separate myself from the design: Try to see things from the other person’s perspective and be open-minded. What I like might not be what other people like, that's why it's important not to be egotic about my design and refuse others' critique.
- Use feedback wisely: not all feedback will be useful. Take what helps, explain respectfully if you disagree, and show that you appreciate the input.
## What are common mistakes when giving or receiving design feedback?
**When giving**:
- Giving vague feedback: instead of giving a general feedback, try to point out the problems, suggest the solutions or how I should address the problem if I was the designer.
- Being subjective or personal: Avoid focusing on personal likes or dislikes, such as "I like this" or "I don't like that". 
- Being overly negative or destructive: Focus on constructive criticism rather than just pointing out problems. Start with positive points before addressing issue.
**Receiving**:
- Taking feedback personally: Separate the feedback from personal feelings to maintain a professional attitude. 
- Ignoring feedback: Even if the feedback isn't immediately useful, acknowledge it and consider it. 
- Blindly implementing every suggestion: While it's important to listen, critically evaluate the feedback and determine if it aligns with the design goals and user needs.
- Asking for feedback too late: Seek input early in the design process so you have enough time to incorporate it effectively. 

# 📝 Reflection
## What is the difference between personal opinion and objective UX critique?
To me, personal opinion is when feedback is based on taste, like “I don’t like the orange color in Focus Bear.” That’s not really about usability, it’s just preference. Objective critique is when feedback points to something that actually impacts the experience, like “The orange text is hard to read on a white background.” That’s about accessibility and clarity, not just someone’s taste.
## If someone gives vague feedback like "I don’t like this", how would you get more useful input?
I’d ask follow-up questions to dig deeper. For example, if someone says “I don’t like the routines feature,” for example:

- “What part feels confusing or frustrating?”
- “Did you expect it to work differently?”
- “Can you walk me through what you were trying to do?”
That way, instead of just knowing they “don’t like it,” I’d understand whether it’s the layout, the habit editing flow, or something else.
## How can you ensure that design critique sessions are productive rather than overwhelming?
From my experience, it helps to set a focus before the session. If we’re testing Focus Bear’s onboarding, I’d keep the discussion on that instead of letting it wander into routines or colors. I’d also make sure to create a constructive environment, so everyone feels that their opinions are valued. It's also important to maintain the balance between positive and negative feedback, for example: “The navigation was clear, but the habit reordering felt clunky.” Hearing both positives and negatives makes critique easier to take in. And I’d try to keep sessions small and conversational, so it feels like teamwork rather than being “attacked.”
