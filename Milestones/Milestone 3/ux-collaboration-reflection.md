## How can UX ensure a smooth handoff between design and development?
From my experience, a smooth handoff starts well before the ‚Äúhandoff‚Äù moment. I make sure my Figma files are clearly labeled, with components, spacing, and color tokens consistent across the project. I include notes and annotations directly on the designs so developers don‚Äôt have to guess what an interaction should do. I‚Äôve found that walking through the prototypes in a short meeting helps everyone get on the same page, it also gives developers a chance to flag technical concerns early. Keeping communication open throughout the sprint, not just at the start, prevents small misinterpretations from becoming big problems later.
## What challenges might arise when design, dev, and product teams have conflicting priorities?
Conflicts can happen when design is pushing for the ideal user experience, development is focused on technical feasibility, and product is driven by timelines or business goals. This can be frustrating because each team‚Äôs priority is valid but different. I‚Äôve learned that the best way to navigate this is to focus on shared goals, making sure the product is valuable, usable, and deliverable. Having open discussions about trade-offs helps us land on solutions that balance user needs with time and technical constraints.
## If a developer modifies a UX design due to technical limitations, how should a UX designer respond?
A UX designer should start by asking the developer why the change is needed and what‚Äôs causing the limitation. If the change makes the design harder to use, they should work together to find another solution that still works for the user, even if it‚Äôs a simpler version. For me, it‚Äôs about collaboration even if the solution isn‚Äôt exactly what I envisioned, it should still deliver the intended experience for the user.
