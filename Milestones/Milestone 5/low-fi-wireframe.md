 This is my lo-fi prototypes for the Edit Habit webview. I have designed 3 options for the Timing Tab and 2 for the Edit Habit.
 After reviewing my design, the supervisor and team chose the second option of the Timing tab. They also gave me critics on the Edit Habits:
- Users should make multiple changes and save at once => need a Save Button at the bottom of the screen
- Relocate the delete button as putting it next to the text input makes it look like we're encouraging the users to delete the tasks
- use tags only when necessary or itâ€™s too much text. Habit should be made must do.
