#  Research & Learn

## What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?

- **Daily Stand-ups**: daily stand-ups are short, daily meetings to discuss each teammate progress. Everyone will talk about their completed tasks, current tasks, and identify blockers. 

- **Sprint Planning (Scrum)** vs. **Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)**  
  - **Sprint Planning**: A meeting held at the start of each sprint for teams to identify what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved. 
  - **Continuous Prioritization**: In Kanban, tasks are chosen as the team has time for them. Planning happens continuously instead of in fixed sprints.

- **Retrospectives**: A meeting usually after each sprint to review what was successful during the sprint and what can be improved upon. 

- **Backlog Refinement**  
  An ongoing process to ensure the product backlog is updated, prioritized, and ready for future sprints.

## üåç How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?

Agile teams working asynchronously often rely on:
- Project boards (e.g., GitHub Projects, Jira, Trello)
- Shared documentation (e.g., Markdown files, Notion, Confluence)
- Async updates via Slack, Teams, or stand-up bots

- Overlapping hours for key sync meetings (when possible)

- Record meetings and shared meeting notes: Meeting notes can be saved on Confluence for team members to get back when they have time because some people might miss the meetings working across time zones.
- Daily progress check-in: ensure everyone is on the right track and identify any challenges that the team is having.
- Clear guidelines for handoffs and documentation.
- Project boards, backlogs for checking progress and keeping track of task completion.
- Use Github for shared coding base.

### Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
I believe that retrospective is the most important for my role as it helps me to reflect on my progress and learn from the feedbacks I got to improve my work in the future.
