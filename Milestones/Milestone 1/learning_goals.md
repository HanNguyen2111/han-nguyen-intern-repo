# What Do You Want to Learn & Contribute?

## What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I hope to learn how to collaborate with other team members, communicate with my seniors and the stakeholders, and improve my technical skills for future career. 
## What skills are you most excited to develop?
I'm most excited to develop my communication skill in professional environment such as conduct meetings with teams, demonstrating my deliverables to the stakeholders or discuss the project progress with the Project Manager. Technical-wise, I hope to be proficient at using the work tools such as Figma for building wireframes, GitHub and Git for shared workspace, and testing methods (QA).

## What do you think you can contribute to the team?
As a UX designer intern, I believe I can contribute my creativity and passion to design a user-centric interface for the app. Although I still have so much to learn, I still hope that my contribution could be meaningful to the development team and the users. I'm also a user myself, so I could evaluate the UI when using the Focus Bear app and give some valuable feedback to the team. 

## What is one area you feel less confident in that youâ€™d like to improve?
I don't feel too confident in my designing skill and using Figma as I have little exposure to the tool. My background is in front-end development, however, I'd take this chance to try and learn new things. It could turn out to be a useful skill for me in the future. I greatly appreciate the structured onboarding since it helps guide me through the process step by step and give me space and time to adapt to the new project. 

## What does success in this internship look like for you?
To me, success in this internship is completing all the tasks assigned in time with an outstanding quality and gain recognition from the seniors in the industry. I hope I'll feel more confident about my technical skill as well as communication skill and have faith in my ability to grow and adapt.
