## What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
Focus Bear provides users with pre-made habit routines that can be customised. This help guide new users to form good common habits such as drinking water or doing a quick mindfulness break. It also includes embedded videos for both instruction and light entertainment, so users stay productive even during wait times. Unlike other apps like Cold Turkey or Freedom, which mainly block websites, Focus Bear feels more like a guide that helps with habit tracking, focus, blocking distractions, and sends friendly reminders to keep you on track.
## If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
I’d choose Focus Bear because it gives more structure and support, not just blocking tools. It makes it easier to start and stick to a routine by guiding you step-by-step. The experience also feels more fun and encouraging, which is helpful for people who get overwhelmed easily or want a softer approach to productivity.
## What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
Routinery has start routine based on location and share your routine.
Tiimo has a calendar intergration and visual planning.
Cold Turkey has statistical report on user's usage and CLI control.
## Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
Focus Bear could improve by adding calendar integration or a visual timeline view, so users can plan and adjust their routines more easily.
