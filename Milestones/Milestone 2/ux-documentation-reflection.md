# üîç Research & Learn

## What types of UX documentation are typically created in Google Docs?
- Design ideas and rationale
- User research results
- Meeting notes
- Feedback or Usability test reports
- User personas and user flows
## How should design decisions and rationale be documented for future reference?
- Outline the key points why I made this design decision
- The main design principles I followed (accessibility, simplicity, etc)
- trade-offs. For example, picking a simpler layout instead of adding more features to make it easier for users to focus.

## What is the best way to structure user research findings to make them easy to read?
1. Quick summary of findings
2. User details (age group, demographic, occupation, etc)
3. key insights
4. Evidence (quotes, screenshots, photos, or data points that back up the insights)
5. Highlight priorities: mark which findings are critical
6. Recommendations: suggested actions or design changes based on the findings.
## How can UX documentation be used to support accessibility and inclusive design?
Include accessibility notes in every document like WCAG checks. Record design choices that impact accessibility (color contrast, keyboard navigation, alt text) so they‚Äôre not lost later.

# Reflection
## If you conducted a user testing session, how would you document the results?
I‚Äôd use a Google Doc starting with a quick overview: date, participant profile, and testing goals. 
Then I‚Äôd list the main findings in bullet points with screenshots or participant quotes for context. Feedback would be grouped into themes like usability issues, positives, and improvement ideas. 
I‚Äôd finish with clear action steps so the team knows exactly what to do next.
## How can a well-structured UX document help prevent miscommunication between teams?
A well-structured UX document keeps everyone on the same page by showing both the design process and the reasoning behind decisions. It helps cross-functional teams stay aligned, reduces misunderstandings, and makes collaboration smoother. 
## What challenges might arise when writing UX documentation, and how can you avoid them?
One challenge is making it too long with too many text, so key points get lost. Another is using design terms that non-designers won‚Äôt get. I‚Äôd keep it clear with headings, bullet points, and visuals, and write in plain language. I‚Äôd also keep it updated so it stays useful.
