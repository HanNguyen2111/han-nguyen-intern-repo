# üìù Reflection & Task Notes

## Reflection

**What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?**  
- Always use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible. I have enabled MFA for my GitHub account and Google accounts to be more secure.  
- Limit access to sensitive information only to those who need it. For example, if I share a link of my design, I only give users permission to view but not edit it.

**How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?**  
- **Store:** Use encrypted drives or password-protected folders; avoid storing sensitive data on public or shared devices.  
- **Share:** Use secure methods (e.g., encrypted emails, approved file-sharing platforms) and confirm the recipient‚Äôs identity.  
- **Dispose:** Permanently delete files using secure wipe methods, and shred physical documents if needed.  

**What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?**  
- Using weak or repeated passwords ‚Üí Use strong, unique passwords with a password manager.  
- Leaving devices unlocked or unattended ‚Üí Always lock screens and devices when not in use.  
- Sharing sensitive data via unsecured channels (e.g., personal email or chat apps) ‚Üí Always verify secure methods.  
- Ignoring software updates ‚Üí Enable automatic updates or regularly check for patches.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

**Habit or practice to improve data security:**  
- Implement a daily habit of checking that all sensitive files are stored in encrypted locations and that shared links have proper access restrictions.

**Key learning or security measure to implement:**  
- Always double-check the recipient and the method when sharing sensitive information, and delete or archive files that are no longer needed to reduce exposure risk.
