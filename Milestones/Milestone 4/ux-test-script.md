A brief introduction (explain the purpose, that you’re testing the app, not the user).
A scenario for the test participant to follow (e.g., "Imagine you just downloaded Focus Bear. Try to set up a focus session.").
Follow-up questions (e.g., "What was easy? What was confusing?").
# Introduction:
Hi there, thank you for your help today!  
We’re testing **Focus Bear**, a productivity app designed to reduce distractions and support focus, especially for neurodivergent users.  

This session is about testing the **app**. There are no right or wrong answers — we just want to see how people interact with it. If you get stuck, that’s completely fine and very valuable for us to learn from. Please think aloud as you go through the tasks so we can understand your thought process.  
## Scenario & Tasks

1. **Navigate to edit habits**  
   Imagine you want to adjust your daily routine. Try to find where you can edit the habits in the app.  

2. **Understand the tabs**  
   Look at the tabs in the Edit Habits section.  
   - What do you think each tab means?  
   - What would you expect to see under them?  

3. **Timing tab**  
   The app asks you a few questions when setting up routines in the Timing Tab.  
   - Do these questions feel relevant to you?  
   - If not, what kinds of questions would feel more useful?  

4. **Add & edit a habit**  
   Try adding a new habit, renaming it, and then changing the order of habits.  
   - How easy or difficult was this?  
   - How did it make you feel?  

5. **Explore the design**  
   Spend a minute exploring the Edit Habits section.  
   - What do you think of the layout, font sizes, and colors used?  
   - Is anything distracting or hard to read?  

## Follow-up Questions
- Overall, how did you feel about editing routines?  
- What part was easiest for you?  
- What part was confusing or frustrating?  
- Did the app behave as you expected? Why or why not?   
- If you could make changes about this feature, what would it be?
