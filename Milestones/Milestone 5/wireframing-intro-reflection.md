## What is a wireframe, and how does it differ from a prototype?
Wireframe is basic structure of a design showing the userflow. It acts like a blueprint that helps teams align on requirements. The wireframe shows the design team and stakeholders the bare-bones outlines of essential webpages, components, and features, including:
- Screen layouts
- Navigation bars
- Components of UX and UI design
- Interactive elements

A prototype, on the other hand, is more advanced. It shows not just the structure, but also the interactions. Prototypes often include clickable flows, visuals, and sometimes animations to give a sense of how the product will actually behave.
## What are the key differences between low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes?
- Low-fidelity wireframe: are basic wireframes focused on layout, navigation, and information architecture. They show what the interface will look like, illustrating user flows with key UI design elements. Physical whiteboard sketches can work at early wireframing stages
- High-fidelity: look like early product mockups, with interactive and visual design elements, but without the functionality of low-fidelity prototypes. At this point of the design process, the wireframe should add brand elements like fonts, colors, and logos. That way, it can capture the look and feel of the final product for user testing.
## When should wireframes be used in the UX design process?
Wireframes are most useful early in the design process, once requirements are gathered but before jumping into visual design. They‚Äôre a way to quickly test ideas, get feedback, and make sure the team is aligned on structure and functionality before investing time in polished mockups or code.
## How do wireframes improve collaboration between UX, PMs, and developers?
Wireframes are super useful for collaboration because they give everyone the same starting point to work from.
- For UX designers, they‚Äôre a quick way to show how the flow and structure should work.
- For product managers, they provide a clear visual to check if the design lines up with business goals.
- For developers, they spell out what features need to be built and how screens connect, which cuts down on confusion later.
Since wireframes are simple and visual, it‚Äôs easier for the whole team to spot gaps, give feedback, and get aligned on the direction early on.
# üìù Reflection
## What are the benefits of starting with wireframes rather than jumping into high-fidelity design?
Wireframes are a good way to get the structure right without getting stuck on colors, fonts, or branding too early. They‚Äôre quick to make and easy to change, so you can test different ideas fast. It also helps the team agree on the basics before spending time polishing.
## How can wireframes help identify usability issues early?
Wireframes help catch usability issues early because they strip things down to the basics. Since they‚Äôre just a simple blueprint, you can test user flows and navigation without spending much time or money. This makes it easy to spot problems with layout, feature placement, or navigation before investing in full design and development.
For example, in Focus Bear, someone might want to see the final dashboard design right away. But if we jumped straight into high-fidelity, we‚Äôd probably waste time making a polished layout that doesn‚Äôt actually help users. Wireframing let us figure out what was most important to show (like streaks or daily routines) before adding the visuals.
## If a stakeholder asks for a high-fidelity design too soon, how would you explain the value of wireframing?
I‚Äôd say wireframes are like blueprints. You wouldn‚Äôt decorate a house before the walls are built. Once the flow and layout are sorted, then we can make it look polished. Skipping that step just means more work later if we have to change things.
