# 📝 Reflection
## If a developer tells you a design is too complex to implement, how would you respond?
I’d dig deeper and ask which part is tricky. Maybe it’s the data handling, maybe it’s the animations. From there, I’d look for compromises, like swapping fancy transitions for simpler ones that still get the point across. In Focus Bear, if an animated reminder system is too heavy, we could replace it with a cleaner fade-in that keeps the flow without draining resources.
## What are some non-visual factors (e.g., performance, accessibility, load time) that can impact a UX design?
- Performance: Slow load times kill engagement.
- Accessibility: Weak color contrast or no keyboard navigation excludes users.
- Responsiveness: If it doesn’t work on mobile, people won’t use it.
- Timing: Badly timed notifications or interruptions ruin focus.
## How can UX designers help find middle-ground solutions between ideal design and technical feasibility?
By keeping the focus on user needs, not perfection. Instead of insisting on one exact design, I’d say, “The key is making sure users don’t feel overloaded.” From there, I’d work with devs to adjust. For example, Focus Bear’s dashboard could be simplified into a lighter checklist version that is faster to build, but still effective for keeping users on track.
