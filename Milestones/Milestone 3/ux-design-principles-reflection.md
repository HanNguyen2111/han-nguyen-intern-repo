## What are Focus Bear‚Äôs design priorities? (Simplicity, low-friction interactions, accessibility)
Focus Bear design priorities are:
- Simplicity: Keeping interfaces clean and uncluttered so users can focus on tasks.
- Low-friction interactions: Making actions easy and intuitive, reducing steps or confusion.
- Accessibility: Designing for a wide range of users, including neurodivergent users, by providing options for text size, contrast, and display modes.
## How should UI elements, colors, and typography support neurodivergent users?
To support neurodivergent users:
- UI elements: buttons, menus, and icons should be clear, predictable, and easy to identify. Layout must be simple and consistent for easy navigation,
- Colors: Opt for calm, muted colors rather than bright, intense ones to avoid sensory overload. Ensure enough contrast between text and background colors for easy readability. 
- Typography: Use simple, sans-serif fonts like Arial, Verdana, or Century Gothic, as they are generally easier to read. Ensure that font sizes are large enough for comfortable reading and allow users to adjust them. Avoid too decorative and complex fonts. 
- Use appropriate line height and spacing to improve readability and reduce visual clutter. 
## Why does consistency in navigation & interaction patterns matter for usability?
Consistency in navigation and interaction patterns is crucial for usability because it reduces user confusion, cognitive load, and learning time, ultimately leading to a more efficient and enjoyable user experience. When users encounter familiar and predictable interfaces, they can easily navigate, understand how to interact with elements, and complete tasks without frustration. 
## How can small UI details (e.g., button placement, animations, tooltips) improve or harm usability?
**Improve usability**:
- Placing buttons where users expect them.
- Using subtle animations to show state changes or progress.
- Tooltips and hints that explain functionality without cluttering the screen.
**Harm usability**:
- Buttons placed inconsistently or in hidden areas.
- Distracting or excessive animations.
- Tooltips or pop-ups that appear unexpectedly and interrupt focus.

# üìù Reflection
## How can Focus Bear maintain a minimal, distraction-free UI while still offering powerful features?
Focus Bear can stay clean by showing only the things users need right now and hiding extra options behind menus or toggles. This way, the screen isn‚Äôt cluttered, but users can still access advanced tools when they want them. For example, in the Desktop app, Focus Bear hides personalized settings under Preferences. It might take a little longer to navigate, but it keeps the interface minimal and distraction-free.
## If a design change improves aesthetics but reduces usability, how should UX handle it?
UX should always put usability first. If a change makes the app prettier but harder to use, it‚Äôs better to test it with users and adjust. The goal is to keep it both easy to use and nice to look at, not just one or the other. When I design for Focus Bear, I liked using brighter, livelier colors, but I had to remember that if a design looks good to me but doesn‚Äôt help users, it‚Äôs not a good design. For neurodivergent users, bright or bold colors can feel overwhelming, so it‚Äôs important to keep the visuals calm and simple.
## What are the risks of overloading users with too many choices or settings?
Having too many options can confuse users and make it hard to decide what to do. It can slow people down, cause mistakes, or make them give up. For neurodivergent users, too many choices can be especially overwhelming and distracting. For instance, if settings are displayed directly in the task views, users can feel cognitively overloaded because there‚Äôs just too much to process at onc
