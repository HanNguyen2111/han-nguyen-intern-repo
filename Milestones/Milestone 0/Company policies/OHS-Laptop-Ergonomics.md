# üìù Reflection
## What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)
I could use a laptop stand so I‚Äôm not always looking down at the screen. An external monitor would also help a lot. Having a proper chair or even just a cushion for back support would make sitting more comfortable. A separate keyboard and mouse would also stop me from hunching forward.
## What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)
I should sit upright with both feet flat on the ground and avoid leaning too much. Taking short breaks every hour to stretch or walk around would help. I could also raise my screen to eye level so my neck isn‚Äôt bent all the time.
## How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)
I can set up movement break reminders in Focus Bear, since that‚Äôs built-in. Alarms on my phone or quick sticky notes on my desk saying things like ‚ÄúSit straight‚Äù or ‚ÄúTime to move‚Äù could also work.
# üõ†Ô∏è Task
## Adjust your laptop setup based on ergonomic best practices.
I raised my laptop using a stack of books as I don't have a stand yet so the screen sits closer to eye level. I also pushed my chair in and made sure my feet are flat on the floor. Already feels a bit more comfortable.
## Identify at least one piece of equipment that could improve your posture and comfort.
 - An office chair with back support.
 - A small tool under my feet to keep it flat, as I'm quite short.
 - A monitor to avoid the bent neck.
## Try using posture and movement reminders for a full workday and note any improvements. (Hint: Focus Bear has built-in reminders for movement breaks!)
I tried set a micro break to remind myself to stand up and stretch after a focus session. Later at night, my neck and shoulders feel less sore than normal and my eyes are not twitching as before, when I stared at the screen for a long time without resting my eyes.
## Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.
I used an office chair with comfort cushion and back support, which can be tilted to suit your posture. I normally set it straight and rest my back completely on it to make sure I'm sitting straight with my feet on the ground (actually a stool) while still being comfortable. I also have an external monitor to help extend the view to my eye level and avoid bending my neck.
