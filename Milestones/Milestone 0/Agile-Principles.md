 # Module 1: Agile Principles & Frameworks
## üîç Research & Learn

### What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?
    Agile is a project management approach that breaks work into smaller phases, focusing on continuous delivery and improvement. It supports teams with flexible planning, fast execution, and regular feedback, which resulting in more effective and responsive outcomes.
    
    Agile is different from the traditional method of project management as it offers greater flexibility, faster feedback cycles, and more frequent value delivery. It thrives in environments where change is expected, customer needs evolve, and the teams want to deliver iteratively
### What are the core values and principles of Agile? (Hint: Check the Agile Manifesto.)
## Core values ##
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
## Agile principles ##
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.

### What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?
## Differences: ##:
    - Kanban is a method using kanban board to visualise the workload. Kanban focuses on efficiency and reducing time a project might take to finish. There are no fixed sprints or required roles, and teams continuously pull tasks based on capacity and priority. Changes can be made at any time, which makes Kanban suitable for environments where priorities shift often.
    - Scrum is an interative and incremental approach to manage the project progress. The teams follow defined process and have specific roles assigned to each member. Scrum teams commit to completing an increment of work, which is potentially shippable, through set intervals called sprints. Their goal is to create learning loops to quickly gather and integrate customer feedback. 

## Used when: ##:
- Scrum if the teams want to benefit from structure, regular feedback loops, and working in short, focused cycles. It works well when project requirements are more stable with predictable delivery.
- Kanban is a better fit when the teams need to stay flexible, priorities change frequently, or dealing with a continuous stream of work rather than project-based tasks.

### Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?
- Focus Bear works on features that change based on user feedback, so flexibility is important.
- The team may not work in strict sprint cycles‚Äîthey release updates as soon as they‚Äôre ready.
- Kanban is simpler to manage and better suited for a small team or startup with changing priorities.
- It helps the team visualise work and limit how much is in progress at once, which boosts focus and flow.

## üìù Reflection

### What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?
    One of the biggest benefits of Agile is its iterative approach, which breaks down large problems into smaller, manageable tasks. This allows teams to solve issues step by step in a structured way. It also improves project productivity, makes task tracking more efficient, and supports continuous improvement through regular user feedback. 
    
    However, a key challenge with Agile, especially in frameworks like Scrum, is that it‚Äôs often sprint-based. This can limit flexibility in projects where rapid changes are needed to meet shifting customer requirements. In fast-paced environments, waiting for the next sprint to adjust priorities may slow things down
### How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?
    Agile's emphasis on continuous improvement and fast feedback fits well with my role. I can share early designs like wireframes or prototypes with the team and users to gather feedback quickly and make changes quickly. This approach helps me stay user-focused and adapt designs based on real needs. Agile principles also help me work more efficiently by supporting a flexible and iterative design process. Since our team doesn‚Äôt work in fixed sprints, I can pick up tasks based on priority and capacity, allowing me to focus on one thing at a time without being overwhelmed by long-term planning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

### Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.
    Scrum is a structured framework that works in short sprints, with clear roles like Scrum Master and Product Owner. Teams plan the work at the start of each sprint and stick to it until the sprint ends. Kanban is more flexible as it doesn‚Äôt have fixed sprints or roles. Tasks are pulled and worked on continuously based on team capacity. You can adjust priorities at any time. Scrum works well when you want regular planning and review cycles, while Kanban is great when you need to respond quickly to changes.
### Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.
    ‚ÄúWelcome changing requirements, even late in development.‚Äù
    I find this principle most useful because in my role, priorities can change based on user feedback or business needs. Being able to adapt quickly helps me build better solutions that actually meet real user expectations.
