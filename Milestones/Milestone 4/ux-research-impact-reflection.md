# üîç Research & Learn
## How does UX research influence design iterations and feature development?
UX research influences design iterations and feature development by identify usability problems, gather feedback on design concepts, and validate design decisions. It helps us avoid designing based on what we think instead of what users actually want.
## What are examples of research-driven design decisions?
1/ Reducing cognitive load with simple and clean layout
- Research finding: Surveys from neurodivergent users show they feel overwhelmed by cluttered layouts.
- Design decision: Add a ‚Äúminimalist mode‚Äù that hides secondary features until needed.
2/ Color for Accessibility
- Research finding: Accessibility testing finds that bright red error messages are stressful for some users with ADHD or autism.
- Design decision: Switch to softer but still high-contrast colors, paired with icons and plain-text error messages.
3/ Feature prioritisation
- Research finding: Analytics data shows that only 5% of users use a complex advanced feature, but 80% request better reminders.
- Design decision: Allocate development time to improve reminders instead of expanding underused features.
## What happens when design choices ignore user feedback?
When design choices ignore user feedback, the product couldn't satisfy user practical needs. The product often ends up looking good on paper but feels frustrating in real life. Users might struggle to complete tasks, abandon the app, or switch to a competitor that better understands their needs. For neurodivergent users especially, ignoring feedback can mean the app becomes overwhelming or unusable. In the end, the product fails to meet its purpose.
## How can user research and usability testing prevent major UX failures?
By observing how real people interact with the product, designers can spot problems early, before they grow into bigger issues. For example, usability testing might show that a key button is hard to find, or that onboarding feels too rushed. Fixing these things before launch saves time, money, and user frustration. It also builds trust, because users feel heard and supported when their feedback leads to real improvements.

# üìù Reflection
## If research contradicts a designer‚Äôs personal preference, what should happen?
If research shows something different from what I personally prefer, I should always go with the research as my personal preferences might not be what the users want. For example, with Focus Bear, I personally like brighter colors because they feel lively, but research shows that neurodivergent users often find bold or flashy colors overwhelming. In that case, I‚Äôd put my preference aside and keep the calmer color scheme, since it actually helps users focus.
## How can UX designers ensure that their work aligns with real user needs?
The best way is to keep checking designs against actual feedback through usability testing, interviews, or even quick surveys. For example, during Focus Bear‚Äôs onboarding, instead of assuming users understand the flow, we can test it with real people and see if they get stuck. If they do, we can simplify the steps or add clearer instructions.
## What risks come with relying on assumptions rather than research when designing an interface?
If I rely only on assumptions, I risk designing something that looks nice but does not work for the people who need it. For instance, in Focus Bear, assuming that adding more customisation options is always better could actually overwhelm neurodivergent users. Too many toggles or advanced settings on the main screen might make the app stressful. Research helps avoid these mistakes. It might reveal that hiding advanced options under ‚ÄúPreferences‚Äù keeps the main interface minimal and easy to use.
