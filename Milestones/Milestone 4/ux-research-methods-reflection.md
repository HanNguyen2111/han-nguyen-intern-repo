# üîç Research & Learn
## What are the two main types of UX research? (Qualitative vs. Quantitative)
- Qualitative: is findings on user behaviour assessment. This research could be done via different methods such as interviews, contextual observation, field studies, and usability test.
- Quantitative: is a researh method that used to quantify the problem by generating statistical data. Common data collection methods are surveys, polls, etc.
## What are common UX research methods (e.g., user interviews, usability testing, surveys, A/B testing)?
**Qualitative Methods:**
- User Interviews: One-on-one conversations with users to gather in-depth insights into their experiences, motivations, and pain points. 
- Usability Testing: Observing users as they interact with a product or prototype to identify areas of difficulty and areas of success. 
- Focus Groups: Moderated discussions with a group of users to gather feedback and insights on a product or concept. 
- Ethnographic Research: Observing users in their natural environment to understand their behavior and context of use. 
- Diary Studies: Users record their experiences with a product or service over a period of time, providing ongoing feedback. 

**Quantitative Methods:**
- Surveys: Collecting data from a large number of users through structured questionnaires.
- A/B Testing: Comparing two versions of a product or feature to see which performs better based on user behavior.
- Heatmaps: Visualizing user behavior on a website or app, showing where users click, scroll, and spend time.
- Analytics Tracking: Using website and app analytics to understand user behavior and identify areas for improvement. 
**Other Methods:**
- Card Sorting: Users group and categorize content into a structure that makes sense to them, helping to inform navigation and information architecture.
- Tree Testing: Users are given a task and asked to navigate a website's structure to find specific information, helping to identify areas of confusion in the information architecture.
- Heuristic Evaluation: Experts evaluate a product against established usability principles to identify potential issues. 

## When should you use observational research vs. self-reported feedback?
- Observational research: Best when we want to see real behavior rather than relying on what people say they do. For example, watching someone navigate an app can reveal struggles they might not mention.
- Self-reported feedback: Best when we want to understand feelings, opinions, or motivations. Surveys and interviews help us capture what users think and why they do things.
## What are the benefits and limitations of remote vs. in-person UX research?
**Remote research:**
- Benefits: Flexible, easier to reach many users, cheaper.
- Limitations: Harder to notice body language or subtle frustrations, may miss context.

**In-person research:**
- Benefits: Richer insights, can observe non-verbal cues, easier to guide participants.
- Limitations: More expensive, time-consuming, limited to local users.

# üìù Reflection
## If Focus Bear wanted to improve its onboarding experience, which UX research methods would be most useful?
For onboarding, I think usability testing and user interviews would be the most valuable. Watching new users go through the sign-up and first-time setup can quickly reveal where they get stuck or confused. Follow-up interviews would help us understand why those steps felt tricky and what could make the process smoother. A short survey afterwards could also give us a broader view of common issues.
## What challenges might arise when collecting self-reported user feedback?
The biggest challenge is that what people say isn‚Äôt always what they do. Sometimes users forget details, give polite answers, or just don‚Äôt know exactly why something feels hard. There‚Äôs also the risk of getting feedback that‚Äôs too vague to act on, like ‚Äúit‚Äôs confusing‚Äù without specifics. That‚Äôs why pairing feedback with observational research is so important.
## How can UX designers avoid bias when conducting research?
I‚Äôve learned to keep my questions neutral and avoid hinting at the ‚Äúright‚Äù answer. For example, instead of asking ‚ÄúDid you find this feature helpful?‚Äù I‚Äôd ask ‚ÄúHow did you use this feature?‚Äù. I also try to test with a mix of users, not just people who already like or understand the product. Finally, I remind myself to look at real behavior and not just what I expect to see.
