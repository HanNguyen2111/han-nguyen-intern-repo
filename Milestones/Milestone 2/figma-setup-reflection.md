# üîç Research & Learn
## What are the core features of Figma, and how is it different from other design tools?
**Core features**
- Design and prototype in one place.
- Dev Mode: Translate designs into code.
- FigJam: Collaborate with a digital whiteboard.
- Figma Slides: Co-create presentations.
- Illustrate with advanced vector tools.
**How is it different from other design tools**
Unlike tools like Sketch or Adobe XD, Figma works directly in the browser with real-time collaboration, so no need to send files back and forth. Figma is also cloud-based, meaning multiple designers can work on the same project in real-time without worrying about file versions
## How does Figma support collaboration between designers, developers, and PMs?
Figma allows multiple people to work on the same file at the same time. Designers can create and update designs while PMs and developers add comments or inspect designs for details. Developers can easily grab code snippets, measurements, and assets right from Figma without extra tools.
## What are components, variants, and auto-layout, and how do they improve design efficiency?
- Components: are reusable elements like buttons or icons that can be updated once and change everywhere
- Variants: group and organise similar components into a single container. This simplifies the component library and makes it easier for everyone to find what they need.
- Auto-layout: can be used on frames so that designs will respond dynamically to content changes, making the designs responsive and adaptable.
## How do you share and hand off designs to developers using Figma?
Using the link and sending invitation to the development team. I'd put components and prototypes in separate pages and clearly mark which ones are ‚Äúready for development‚Äù
# üìù Reflection
## How would you organize a design system in Figma to ensure consistency?
- Create a dedicated Figma file just for your design system.
- Group components into categories (e.g., Buttons, Forms, Navigation, Typo, Color, etc).
- Use clear and consistent naming conventions (e.g., Button/Primary/Large).
- Document usage guidelines directly in the file (via Notes).
## If a developer needs details about a design component, how would you provide that using Figma?
- Use component descriptions in Figma to note intended usage and behavior.
- Highlight auto-layout, padding, and constraints so spacing is understood.
- Direct them to the Inspect panel where CSS and properties are automatically generated.

## What challenges might arise when collaborating in Figma, and how can you avoid them?
- No version control makes it very hard to know which features are recently added. To avoid confusion, we should inform our team when we add a new design or make changes
- Hard to find assests and components as there're too many things in a file. We should maintain a clear file structure and naming conventions to make it easier for everyone to locate components or prototypes.
- Many pages and designs make it difficult for new team member to understand what is going on. To avoid this, designers should use notes and annotation to explain the purpose of each page
